Nextjs testing project
messing with react-icons, tailwindcss
i haven't learn much about Nodejs at the moment so i can't store songs in db

Main idea:
use playing to toggle state of songs,
use selectSong to link state of song to Header, icon change for song and sperate with the next song

Problems: took me fking 8 hours just to know that you can't connect to DB in front-end :)
